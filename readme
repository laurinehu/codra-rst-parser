This repo is a mirror of the Joty et al (2015) CODRA RST discourse parser
(original URL: http://alt.qcri.org/tools/discourse-parser/).

If you are looking for a *simple* way to install and run CODRA,
please have a look at my other repo https://github.com/NLPbox/codra-docker .

If you are interested in seeing graphical output of your parse trees,
need to convert between different RST file formats
and/or would like to use other RST parsers as well, check out
https://github.com/arne-cl/rst-workbench for an overview.

For parsing a raw text, you should run discourse segmenter followed by discourse parser.  

------------------------
Running Discourse Segmenter:

Command:
	python Discourse_Segmenter.py <infile>

Required packages/tools:

1. Charniak's reranking parser (Available from https://github.com/BLLIP/bllip-parser). 
	a. put it in Tools/CharniakParserRerank and install it.

2. Taggers from UIUC (from http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software)
	a. Download POS tagger and shallow chunker [LBJPOS.jar, LBJChunk.jar, LBJ2.jar, LBJ2Library.jar]
        b. Put these in Tools/UIUC_TOOLs/

3. Install scikit-learn and scipy (see for example: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)

4. Install java if not installed (see for example: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java)

5. Make sure the Tools/SPADE_UTILS/bin/edubreak is set to executable.

6. Now run the segmenter using the command above. If it shows errors in apply_model method in loading the model, then it is due to differnt versions of the logistic regression in sklearn. 
	- To overcome this, open the commented "train_model" in do_segment method and run the segmenter. This learns the model and saves it. 
        - If it runs once, you don't need to run train_model again. You should comment it to save time. 

---------------------
Running Discourse Parser:

Command:
	python Discourse_Parser.py <discourse segmented file> 

Required packages:

1. Install wordNet (for example, On ubuntu you can write: apt-get install science-linguistics) and set the WNHOME environment variable to the WordNet directory. WNHOME should contain the dictionary files. 
2. Install WordNet::QueryData (http://search.cpan.org/dist/WordNet-QueryData/QueryData.pm; also provided). To install it properly you may need to set the $wnHomeUnix and $wnPrefixUnix to the appropriate directories.
